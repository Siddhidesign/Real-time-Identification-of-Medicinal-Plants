# Real-time-Identification-of-Medicinal-Plants
A deep learning-based system for real-time identification of medicinal plants using a mobile app. Features include high-accuracy classification with EfficientNet-B1, geospatial tagging, user feedback integration, and a dynamic knowledge base, supporting biodiversity research, conservation, and education.
## Overview

This project is a comprehensive plant identification system that combines deep learning and user-friendly mobile app functionalities to identify medicinal plants in real-time. It features a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to capture or upload plant images for classification. The backend utilizes a deep learning model (EfficientNet-B1) to analyze the images and return predictions, including species names, local names, and plant uses.

### Key Features:
1. **Login System**: A secure login interface authenticates users before accessing the app’s functionalities.
2. **Real-Time Plant Identification**: Users can upload or capture plant images, which are sent to a backend API for analysis. Identified plant details are displayed along with confidence levels.
3. **Feedback Collection**: Users can correct species names or provide additional information by uploading images and submitting feedback, enhancing the system's accuracy over time.
4. **Search History**: The app keeps track of past searches, allowing users to revisit previous results.
5. **Dynamic Learning**: The system integrates user feedback into the database, improving the model’s accuracy and adaptability.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: Flutter framework for an intuitive user interface and smooth cross-platform functionality.
- **Backend**: A RESTful API that processes images and handles user feedback.
- **Deep Learning**: EfficientNet-B1 model for accurate plant classification, trained on public and private datasets.

This project supports biodiversity research and conservation efforts by providing a scalable, interactive, and educational tool for plant identification, while also encouraging user participation to refine its performance.
